               <li><strong>Aries</strong> 
               <br> The Kiesel Guitars Custom Shop is excited to offer the all-new Aries A6 bevel-top bolt neck guitar. The A6 is modeled on the popular SCB6, with similar aesthetics and sleek and stylish looks in a 24-fret, 25.5" scale bolt-on neck configuration. A newly-designed easy-access neck joint with recessed ferrules, Kiesel Lithium pickups and dual carbon-fiber neck rods elevate the A6 to the ranks of elite instruments. The Custom Shop's superior materials and craftsmanship and over 65 years of experience building the highest quality, USA-made instruments that are suitable for all playing styles at any level make the A6 ideal for guitarists that want a 24-fret fingerboard, but prefer the design of a bolt-neck instrument. Hundreds of available options allow you to build your A6 exactly the way you want it, and have an instrument that you'll be proud to play and own for years to come. The A6 is constructed to the highest possible standards of quality and playability by the Kiesel Guitars USA Custom Shop.

               <li><strong>What about Basses?</strong>  
                  
                <br>Following the wildly successful Vader Series headless guitars, and after many requests from our customers, Kiesel Guitars and the Carvin Guitars Custom Shop is excited to announce the new Vader Series headless basses. Vader basses are offered in 4, 5 and 6 string versions, and all three models also offer a 30" short-scale option; another feature that has been requested often. Like the Vader headless guitars, the VB4 Vader headless bass is constructed from premium woods, not composites, so their tone isn't a radical departure from our traditional models. The Vader Series headless basses are made in the USA, and loaded with features, along with having Kiesel Guitars full compliment of Custom Shop options available. It's boutique instrument, without the boutique price, because Kiesel Guitars sells directly to you. You can build your Vader VB4 bass exactly the way you want it, and be the proud owner of an instrument that will last you a lifetime.
